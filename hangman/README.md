This is my first proper React Redux app other than the ones that are used as example.

You should be able to clone, cd into the folder, npm install > npm start as normal and check it out.

From there it's the standard Hangman game, you pick letters from a word called form an api. You have 10 guesses before they hang and you lose. There's a reload button for when you want to start again.

Hope you enjoy!

This is a V0.2 readMe I hope I remember to update!!!
